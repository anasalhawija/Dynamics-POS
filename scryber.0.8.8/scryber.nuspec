    <description>Scryber is an advanced PDF generation tool that allows complete definition of a dynamic PDF document based on XML (and code)
      including cascading styles, databinding and component separation in referenced files.
      This framework is built entirely in .NET and is released under the LGPL licence so you can link to it in commercial applications.
      More information can be found at http://www.scryber.co.uk</description>
    <summary>Quickly build and generate good looking dynamic PDF documents using XML, Cascading styles, and DataBinding. Content flows in pages and can be defined using familiar Divs, Labels, Tables, etc.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>The 0.8.8.0 release is stable but in beta.
      
      Some significant fixes and updates including layout and text fixes.
      
      Document sizes should be smaller (significantly smaller for complex or long documents).
      
      Headings - H1..6 are now fully qualified block components. 
      They support backgrounds, padding, margins and borders, and also still have the text attribute, although they can now have any content.
      This may affect existing layouts - check before release.
      
      Table Row Heading can repeat across regions and pages (style based but default on pdf:Heading-Row)
      
      The 0.8.7 release is stable but in beta.
      Includes new List (Ol, Ul) top level components for creating lists - fully styled and bindable
      Also fixes for multiple namespace xml data sources</releaseNotes>
